   - 10 core pages (Home, Standings, Matches, Groups, Rules, Statistics, Prizes, My Prediction, Admin)
   - Detailed database schema (13 tables)
   - External API integration strategy (Live-Score API)
   - Scoring system with progressive points
   - Security and GDPR requirements
   - Internationalization (English/Dutch)

✅ Generated `feature_list.json` with 255 test cases
   - Categories: Authentication (20), Home Page (15), Prediction System (40)
   - Standings (20), Matches & Groups (25), Statistics (20)
   - Admin Panel (30), API Integration (15), Security (10)
   - Responsive Design (15), Internationalization (5)
   - Email & Notifications (15), Flexible Participation (10), Admin Insights (15)
   - All features include detailed test steps
   - Priority levels assigned (high/medium/low)

✅ Created complete project directory structure
   ```
   client/src/{components,pages,services,hooks,utils,types}
   server/src/{config,models,routes,controllers,middleware,services,jobs,utils}
   database/{migrations,seeders}
   docs/
   ```

✅ Created configuration files
   - `.gitignore` (Node.js, environment files, build outputs)
   - `.env.example` (Database, JWT, API keys, SMTP, tournament settings)

✅ Created `init.sh` automation script
   - Checks for Node.js 18+, npm, PostgreSQL
   - Creates `.env` from example with user prompts
   - Installs dependencies for root, client, server
   - Sets up PostgreSQL database
   - Provides clear next steps

✅ Created comprehensive `README.md`
   - Project overview and key features
   - Quick start guide
   - Project structure documentation
   - Database schema overview
   - How to play and scoring system
   - API integration details
   - Email notification system
   - Security features
   - Development progress tracker
   - Deployment recommendations

✅ Created `agent-progress.txt` (this file)
   - Session-by-session progress tracking
   - Clear status updates for next agent

### Key Design Decisions:

**Flexible Participation**:
- Users can predict ANY number of matches (not forced to predict all 104)
- Scoring only counts predictions that were actually made
- Allows users to skip matches if their team is eliminated
- Leaderboard shows "Predictions Made" count for transparency

**Email & Notifications**:
- Welcome emails on registration
- Deadline reminders (24h and 1h before)
- Match notifications and result updates
- Weekly standings summaries
- Prize winner announcements
- Language-specific templates (EN/NL)

**Admin Insights**:
- Complete customer list with filters
- View any user's predictions
- Participation statistics dashboard
- Winner identification after tournament
- Manual email sending capabilities
- Audit logging for admin actions

**Scoring System**:
- Progressive points in knockout stages (higher stakes = more points)
- Group stage: 5 pts exact, 3 pts winner
- Final match: 20 pts exact, 15 pts winner + correct
- Champion prediction: 30 pts
- Bonus questions: 10-15 pts each
- Tie-breaking: Points → Exact scores → Correct winners → Champion → Registration date

**API Integration**:
- Primary: Live-Score API (fixtures, live scores, standings)
- Fallback: Statorium or Sportmonks
- Updates every 5 minutes during matches
- Automatic scoring calculation on match finish
- Caching with 5-15 minute TTL
- Error handling with cached data fallback

### Files Created:
1. `app_spec.txt` (20,000+ words, complete specification)
2. `feature_list.json` (255 test cases with detailed steps)
3. `.gitignore` (Node.js, databases, build outputs)
4. `.env.example` (All configuration variables)
5. `init.sh` (Automated setup script)
6. `README.md` (Comprehensive project documentation)
7. `agent-progress.txt` (This progress log)
8. `generate_features.py` (Python script to generate feature tests)
9. Directory structure (client, server, database, docs)

### Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. **Initialize Git repository** with first commit
2. **Create root package.json** with scripts
3. **Set up backend foundation**:
   - Database connection configuration
   - Sequelize models for all 13 tables
   - Database migrations
   - Seed data (48 teams, 104 matches, scoring rules)
4. **Build authentication system**:
   - User registration endpoint
   - Login endpoint with JWT
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Middleware for auth protection
5. **Implement user prediction system**:
   - Predictions model and endpoints
   - Save/update predictions
   - Lock after deadline
   - Validation logic
6. **Create scoring engine**:
   - Calculate points after matches
   - Update user statistics
   - Recalculate leaderboards
7. **Build API integration**:
   - Live-Score API client
   - Scheduled jobs for updates
   - Caching layer
8. **Develop frontend pages** (React):
   - Login/Register
   - Home page
   - My Prediction page
   - Standings pages
   - Matches & Groups
   - Admin panel
9. **Add email notifications**:
   - SMTP configuration
   - Email templates (EN/NL)
   - Scheduled reminders
10. **Testing and polish**:
    - E2E tests with browser automation
    - Security hardening
    - Performance optimization
    - Mobile responsive testing

### Notes for Next Agent:
- Project is fully initialized and documented
- All 255 test cases defined in `feature_list.json`
- Focus on backend foundation first (models, auth, API)
- Then build prediction and scoring systems
- Finally create frontend pages
- Test thoroughly before marking features as passing
- Use browser automation for UI testing
- Update this progress log after each session

### Git Status:
- Repository not yet initialized (next step)
- All files ready for initial commit
